CineMatch
CineMatch is an application that allows users to create profiles and rate movies in four categories: storytelling, production value, visuals, and performance. These ratings are used to generate personalized movie recommendations based on the user's taste.

CineMatch is a platform for movie enthusiasts to discover, rate, and receive tailored movie recommendations. Users can create profiles, rate movies across four key aspects of filmmaking, and engage in discussions with fellow movie enthusiasts.
